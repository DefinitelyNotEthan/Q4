# Q4
This was origonally going to be just a calculator for Kepler's third law, however that was way too easy so this will probally be a collection of physics based calculators!
Right now I have...
- Kepler's third law
- Hubble's law
- A Habitable Zone calculator
- A Planck Relation calculator
- A Hawking raditation and luminocity calculator

AGENDA:
- Week of 5/6, finish up Hawking calculator and the presentation slides!
- Week of 5/13, finish up Schwarzschild radius caculator!
