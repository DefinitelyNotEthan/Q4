# Q4
This was origonally going to be just a calculator for Kepler's third law, however that was way too easy so this will probally be a collection of physics based calculators!
Right now I have...
- Kepler's third law
- Hubble's law
- A Habitable Zone calculator
- A Planck Relation calculator
- A Hawking raditation and luminocity calculator

AGENDA:
- Week of 22/4, finish Kepler and Hubble
- Week of 29/4, fix any bugs in Hubble and start reaserching/start coding new laws for this project
- Week of 6/5, bug fixes and start reaserching/start coding new laws for this project (follow this pattern for the rest of quarter four! Keep addding to the collection of calculators for as long as I can!)
